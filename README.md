# AlgorithmAnalysis
Implementation of data structures, and prediction algorithms analysis
# Key Skills developed:
<ul>
  <li>
Algorithm analysis ie: Determine the amount of resources necessary to execute a particular algorithm.
  </li>
   <li>
Understand the structure, nature and use of fundamental data structures
      </li>
   <li>
Implement the data structures in Python.
      </li>
   <li>
Use curve fitting (regression) approach to predict the equation of running time.
 </li>
  <li>
  Successfully write, compile, debug and run programs using these constructs.
  </li>
  </ul>
